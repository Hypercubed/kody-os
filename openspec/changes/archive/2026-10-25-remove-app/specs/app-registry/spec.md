## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: remove_app uninstalls cleanly

`remove_app` SHALL delete the app's definition and state and scrub all of its references (pinned, hidden, recency, homepage order) atomically: either everything is gone or nothing changed. Removing an unknown id SHALL return `{ ok: false }` with a naming error and write nothing. Removing a seeded/prebuilt app SHALL be allowed exactly like any other app. `remove_app` SHALL be exposed only through the MCP surface; the browser shell SHALL NOT call it or render a removal control.

#### Scenario: Full uninstall leaves no references
- **WHEN** `remove_app` runs on an installed app that is pinned, hidden, and recently used
- **THEN** it returns `{ ok: true, id }`, the definition and state keys are gone, and no list anywhere in storage still names the id.

#### Scenario: Removing an unknown app is a clean error
- **WHEN** `remove_app` is called with an id that is not installed
- **THEN** it returns `{ ok: false }` naming the id and writes nothing.
