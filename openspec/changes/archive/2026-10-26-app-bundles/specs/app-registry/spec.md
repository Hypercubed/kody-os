# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Same-id overwrite preserves references
Re-adding an existing id via `add_app` SHALL overwrite the definition, reset state to initial, and leave registry order, pins, hidden flags, homepage placement, and recent entries untouched (only `remove_app` scrubs reference lists).

#### Scenario: Re-added app keeps its route and pins
- **WHEN** an installed app (pinned, on homepage) is re-added under the same id
- **THEN** `GET /apps/<id>` renders the new definition and the id remains in the pinned and homepage lists.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: App definition schema
Every app definition SHALL carry: `id` (stable slug `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`, used for routes and storage keys), `name` (display name), `label` (tile label, defaults to `name`), optional `icon` (plain-text glyph, never emoji, OR sanitized inline SVG), optional `category`, `bundle` (entry `index.html`, relative `.html`/`.js`/`.css` only, 256 KiB cap), `stateSchema` (typed fields plus initial), and `actions` (args schema plus generic `set`/`append` effects, atomic single-write).

#### Scenario: Invalid definition is rejected with a reason
- **WHEN** `add_app` receives a definition with a bad id, bad bundle path, undeclared state field, or a UI action referencing no declared action
- **THEN** it returns `{ ok: false, error }` naming the problem and writes nothing.

#### Scenario: Unified app round-trips
- **WHEN** a unified app is exported then imported into a blank install
- **THEN** definition and state are deep-equal to the originals.

#### Scenario: Unknown template still rejected with reason
- **WHEN** `add_app` receives a definition with a template outside the closed set
- **THEN** it returns `{ ok: false, error }` naming the template and writes nothing.
