# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: App definition schema
Every app definition SHALL carry: `id` (stable slug `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`, used for routes and storage keys), `name` (display name), `label` (tile label, defaults to `name`), optional `icon` (plain-text glyph, never emoji, OR sanitized inline SVG), optional `category`, `bundle` (entry `index.html`, relative `.html`/`.js`/`.css` only, 256 KiB cap), `stateSchema` (typed fields plus initial), and `actions` (args schema plus generic `set`/`append` effects, atomic single-write).

#### Scenario: Invalid definition is rejected with a reason
- **WHEN** `add_app` receives a definition with a bad id, bad bundle path, undeclared state field, or a UI action referencing no declared action
- **THEN** it returns `{ ok: false, error }` naming the problem and writes nothing.

#### Scenario: Unknown template still rejected with reason
- **WHEN** `add_app` receives a definition with a template outside the closed set
- **THEN** it returns `{ ok: false, error }` naming the template and writes nothing.

#### Scenario: Stale version on a new id is rejected with the current version named
- **WHEN** `add_app` receives a new id whose `schemaVersion` is missing or older than current
- **THEN** it returns `{ ok: false, error }` naming the current version and writes nothing.

#### Scenario: Overwrite restamps to current
- **WHEN** `add_app` re-adds an existing id
- **THEN** the stored definition carries the current `schemaVersion` regardless of what was submitted.

#### Scenario: Unified app round-trips
- **WHEN** a unified app is exported then imported into a blank install
- **THEN** definition and state are deep-equal to the originals, including `schemaVersion`.

#### Scenario: Pre-version installs backfill on read
- **WHEN** an app installed before versioning is read back
- **THEN** it reports the current version if it validates against the current shape, else the oldest known version — so stale apps are listable.

#### Scenario: SVG icon accepted
- **WHEN** `add_app` receives a definition with a sanitized inline-SVG icon
- **THEN** it returns `{ ok: true, id }` and the icon renders as SVG on tiles.
